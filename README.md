# Hc

Hc fuses together a REPL an http client and a profile to let you navigate APIs more simply.

Starts `hc` by providing a configuration file.

Here's a simple configuration file:

    name: "omise"

    default_env: "api"

    environments:

      api:
        url: https://api.omise.co/
        user: skey_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      vault:
        url: https://vault.omise.co/
        user: pkey_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  
    store:

      :card: >-
        card[name]=Robin Clart
        card[number]=4242424242424242
        card[expiration_year]=2017
        card[expiration_month]=12
        card[security_code]=123

    plays:

      post_token:
        - 'use vault'
        - 'post /tokens %{card}'
        - 'store token_id id'

      post_charge:
        - 'play create_token'
        - 'use api'
        - 'post /charges amount=100000 currency=thb card=%{token_id}'
        - 'store charge_id id'
